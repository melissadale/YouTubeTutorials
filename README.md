# YouTubeTutorials
Sometimes when I struggle to get something to work, I make a youtube video to help others (and let's face it myself when I forget how I got it working). This repo is for references and code used in those videos.

1. **ATM**: MIT and Michigan State University deliver Auto Tune Models, a tool that takes in csv datafiles and tunes SciKit Learn classifiers, reporting the best performing classifier parameters automatically.

2. **TensorFlow TF Records**: TF Records is a datafile format for TensorFlow. This video shows how to generate TF Records from directories of images.
